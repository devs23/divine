                Either it was Teacher's Day or Inter- House Competition. I still smile while remembering them.
                
                But I've to say "My achievements would be difficult without teachers.
                
                Their ready to help nature made it easy for me to learn more and more and thanks is too small for it. So I just want to promise them to do best in future. I would like to give a piece of advice to all the students that school is a place where you realise your talent, the time to nourish it. So, enjoy your school days while aiming at goal that leads you to success Good luck.</p><p class="text-muted" style="float: right;">Shilpi Aggarwal <br>HBIT,Kanpur</p></div>

                It has been 3 years since I left the school but surprisingly never realized till now when I actually counted the numbers of year on my finger tips. I felt i never left the school... Because everyday something happens that takes my mind and heart back to the school

                I was missing my school days,
                
                games period, morning assembly Teacher's Day celebration. It was for me a hard time then. I learnt that at home, everyone belongs
                
                but at school there's at least one kind in each grade who's left out of the fun. This is the first time in a child's life when he learns how he likes to be treated. It is very crucial lessons in life. I call it the "GOLDEN RULE As I joined the Divine Educational Institute in senior years of class XI and XI has taught me not to procrastinate. We might have got away all night cramming session in high school, but unless we are strictly taking "BIRD CLASS in XI and XII, it is difficult to get good grades without studying throughout the year. I want to say my school life had been awesome and fabulous which I can never forget.</p><p class="text-muted" style="float: right;">Saloni Garg <br>C.S. Delhi</p></div>
